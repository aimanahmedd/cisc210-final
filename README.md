Contribution: Programmed the entire implementation on pi, including 
drawing component, switching color component, and shaking pi to
clear display.

Description: An etch-a-sketch where you are able to draw, change colors,
and shake/bump to clear the screen.

Detailed Usage: To run the program, run make clean, make all, make run.
Once the program starts, you will see a pixel that is lit up in the
middle of the pi. To draw around, toggle the joystick in whichever
direction you choose (up, down, right, left). To change colors press
the joystick to access colors like pink, blue, white, and unlit. Lastly,
when you wish to erase your drawing, simply shake the pi!
